1) Train both models separately and save them

Training procedure:

-> While training the models for the 1st time save the train, test and val partition in a seaparate location

-> When training to work together use the same train, test and val set


What is the logic behind training them separately from the start ?
We want to make use of the pretrained weights that come with the model. Once the model learns to differntiate between images the context will assist it in finalizing the decision.

Another Way:
Like ACGAN instead of providing context only at last layer we keep telling the model (like resnet) what the context it (insert it in between)

One more idea:
Train 3 models (1 for context, 1 for detecting intricate features, 1 for detecting bigger feautres)
